# Data Visualization 

> Jeremy Gerardi

## Mini-Project 1

This project explores the global trends in cybersecurity threats between 2015 and 2024, leveraging R for data visualization. 
The goal is to identify and present key insights on financial losses, types of cyber attacks, and common security vulnerabilities through clear and effective charts.

### Summary of findings:

- Financial losses from cyber attacks have fluctuated over the past decade.
- Certain types of attacks such as DDoS and phishing are more common than others, suggesting that those areas should become high priorities in terms of increasing defense mechanisms.
- Zero-day, social engineering, unpatched software, and weak passwords are almost equally exploited, showing that they should all be thought of as high risk when considering vulnerabilities.
